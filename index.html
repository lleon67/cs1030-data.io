        <h1><b><u>Data Final Project</u></b></h1>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> What distribution company has the most successful opening weekend for Marvel Movies in North America?</p>
        <h3><b><u>Process:</u></b></h3>
        <p>The data included in this data set was chosen for it's variety in information regarding Marvel films. This information includes the title of the film, the film's distributor, the date it was released and the budget. It also included the revenue collected during its opening weekend in the US, North America's overall earnings and revenue earned in other territories and Worldwide. The set (which was acquired <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/minisam/marvel-movie-dataset?select=marvel_reviews.csv">here</a>) was accompanied by another set, which contained information on ratings and reviews for every film. Each set contained both raw data and cleaned data, though the first set was chosen for its variety. The file was downloaded as a CSV file and loaded into Statcrunch, where both the distributor and opening weekend columns were split and organized into a seperate file. Statcrunch, however, does not provide tools for data analysis, so the newly created data set was saved as a CSV file and opened in Excel, where the sum of each column was found with the use of the auto sum tool. After this, with the use of the data analysis tool, a bar plot comparing the total sums of each was created with the total sum of each distributor listed above the bars. The data and the graph both shows that Walt Disney Studios, as a distributor, made the most.</p>
